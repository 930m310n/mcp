# geomelon-mcp

MCP server for the [Geomelon](https://rapidapi.com/hom3chuk/api/geomelon) geographic API. Exposes cities, countries, regions, and languages as tools any MCP-compatible AI client can call.

Two transports are included:

| Binary | Transport | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| `geomelon-mcp` | stdio | Claude Desktop, Cursor, Cline, Continue |
| `geomelon-mcp-http` | HTTP (Streamable) | Claude Code, remote / hosted server |

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- A [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/hom3chuk/api/geomelon) key with the Geomelon API subscribed

---

## Claude Code (HTTP)

Create a `.env` file in the directory you'll run the server from:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# then edit .env and set GEOMELON_API_KEY
```

Start the server (dotenv loads `.env` automatically):

```bash
npx geomelon-mcp-http
```

Register it with Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http geomelon http://localhost:3000/mcp
```

Verify it's connected:

```bash
claude mcp list
```

The server must be running whenever you use Claude Code. To use a different port set `PORT=your_port` and update the URL in the `claude mcp add` command accordingly.

---

## Claude Desktop (stdio)

Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "geomelon": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "geomelon-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "GEOMELON_API_KEY": "your_rapidapi_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop after saving.

## Cursor / Windsurf / Cline (stdio)

Add to your editor's MCP config:

```json
{
  "geomelon": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "geomelon-mcp"],
    "env": {
      "GEOMELON_API_KEY": "your_rapidapi_key_here"
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Remote / hosted HTTP server

Create a `.env` file on your server:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# set GEOMELON_API_KEY and PORT in .env
```

Start the server:

```bash
npx geomelon-mcp-http
```

Then register with any MCP client using `http://your-host:3000/mcp` as the URL.

The HTTP transport is stateless — each request is independent, no session management needed.
